Prototype of a NFT Marketplace based on openZeppelin abstract upgradeable ERC721 contracts and Minting/uploading images to IPFS and integration with Opensea.io

The following functionalities were tested: 

1. Buy a pre-minted token.
2. Sell the token that was bought.
3. Transferring ETH to the previous token holder;
4. Adding and removing tokens from the marketplace;
5. Minting tokens;
6. Uploading NFT image to IPFS;
7. Metadata and marketplace on Opensea.io
8. Metadata and IPFS Lambda functions on AWS
